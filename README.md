# Udacity-Data-Analysis-Term-2-P1-Perceptual-Phenomenon
Introductory project to the Term 2 of the Nanodegree: "Test a Perceptual Phenomenon"

In this project, I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic
result of experimental psychology. A conclusion was reached using the data and statistical inference.
